<p style="font-size:30px;">Monardo's Profiles<p/>
<a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/chickenpotpie234/" target = "_self">Scratch</a>
	<br/>
	Here is my Scratch account, Scratch is just a basic drag and drop coding site that I used to do things in, and that I occasionally still do for the aesthetic of it.
	<br/>
<a href = "https://github.com/Monardo4" target = "_self">Github</a>
	<br/>
	Here is my Github, this is where I put my more serious projects, and where I store the majority of my code.
	<br/>
<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8Rhqm5mXhVrYVSqC06dNzQ/featured" target = "_self">Youtube</a>
	<br/>
	This is my youtube, it's where I put any short films I make, it's mostly stop motion animation and some comedy.
	<br/>
<a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/chickenpotpie234/" target = "_self">3Box</a>
	<br/>
	3Box is a setup for dapps on ethereum, so this is my profile if for some reason you want to see that.
	<br/>
<a href = "https://etherscan.io/address/0xccb90283d816dc38175368ba8b1242933fee8083" target = "_self">Ethereum</a>
	<br/>
	This is my ethereum address, which means that this is where I accept any ethereum cryptocurrency payments.  If you want to pay me in any tokens or ether, you can do so here.
