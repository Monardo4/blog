He's a real nowhere man
<br/>
Sitting in his nowhere land
<br/>
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't have a point of view
<br/>
Knows not where he's going to
<br/>
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
<br/>
Nowhere man please listen
<br/>
You don't know what you're missing
<br/>
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
<br/>
<br/>
He's as blind as he can be
<br/>
Just sees what he wants to see
<br/>
Nowhere man, can you see me at all
<br/>
Nowhere man don't worry
<br/>
Take your time, don't hurry
<br/>
Leave it all 'til somebody else
<br/>
Lends you a hand
<br/>
Ah, la, la, la, la
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't have a point of view
<br/>
Knows not where he's going to
<br/>
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
<br/>
Nowhere man please listen
<br/>
You don't know what you're missing
<br/>
Nowhere man, The world is at your command
<br/>
Ah, la, la, la, la
<br/>
<br/>
He's a real nowhere man
<br/>
Sitting in his nowhere land
<br/>
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
<br/>
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
<br/>
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
