Vexillology is the study of flags.  I like flags.  I think they're cool.  So Here are some flags I designed!

This is a flag I designed for my personal use, you might see it on some of my profiles!  It also turns out that it is the proposed flag for <a href="https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb-s-nui.html" style="color: black">North Uist</a>, so I guess I was on to something when I made it!

This is a flag design I made, it uses a Scandinavian Cross, with a Pall incorporated.  I think it looks kind of neat.

This is a flag I made for Skagit County, which is near where I live.  It is not the official flag, just one I made for fun!

This is just a flag I made that combines a traditional cross flag, with a ringed cross, I think it turned out pretty good.

	<br/>
	<br/>
This flag combines the flag of France and the flag of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_France" style="color: black">Free France</a>, which had the Cross of Lorraine, so I combined them to create this flag.

This design is just a sort of new take on the flag of Monarchist Italy, it takes the elements from the Coat of Arms and spreads them over the whole flag.
